# ✅ Backend Connected! Next Steps

## 🎉 Configuration Complete!

I've created `.env.local` with your Colab backend URL:
```
https://unpronouncing-kaylin-supersufficiently.ngrok-free.dev
```

✅ **Backend is REACHABLE** - connection test successful!

## 🚀 Final Step: Restart Frontend

### Option 1: In Your Current Terminal

1. **Stop the frontend:**
   - Go to the terminal running `npm start`
   - Press **Ctrl+C**

2. **Start it again:**
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

### Option 2: In a New Terminal

If you want to keep the current one, open a new terminal and run:
```powershell
cd d:\dbms
npm start
```

## ✅ What to Look For

After frontend restarts, open: **http://localhost:3000**

You should see at the top:

```
✅ Backend Connected

## 🧪 Test the Translation

1. **Type a query:**
   ```
   Show all students with marks above 80
   ```

2. **Click "Translate"**

3. **You should see 3 SQL candidates:**
   ```sql
   1. SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks > 80;
      Confidence: 95%
      Generated by BART model (beam 1)
   
   2. SELECT * FROM students WHERE marks > 80 ORDER BY marks DESC;
      Confidence: 85%
      Generated by BART model (beam 2)
   
   3. SELECT id, name, marks FROM students WHERE marks > 80;
      Confidence: 75%
      Generated by BART model (beam 3)
   ```

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

### Red "Backend Offline" Badge

**Try:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify the URL in `.env.local` matches your Colab ngrok URL
3. Make sure Colab Step 4 cell is still running

### No SQL Candidates Appear

**Check:**
1. Browser Network tab (F12 → Network) - Are requests going to ngrok URL?
2. Check Colab logs for any errors
3. Try the health endpoint in browser:
   ```
   https://unpronouncing-kaylin-supersufficiently.ngrok-free.dev/api/health
   ```

### Still Shows localhost:8000

**Do this:**
1. Make sure you restarted the frontend AFTER creating `.env.local`
2. Check the file exists: `d:\dbms\.env.local`
3. Verify it contains: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://unpronouncing-kaylin-supersufficiently.ngrok-free.dev`
